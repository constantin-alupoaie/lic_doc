  month = {May},
  abstract = {Over the past decade, webcriminality has become a real issue. Because
	they allow the botmasters to control hundreds to millions of machines,
	botnets became the first-choice attack platform for the network attackers,
	to launch distributed denial of service attacks, steal sensitive
	information and spend spam emails. This work aims at designing and
	implementing a honeynet, specific to IRC bots. Our system works in
	3 phasis: (1) binaries collection, (2) simulation, and (3) activity
	capturing and monitoring. Our phase 2 simulation uses an IRC redirection
	to extract the connection information thanks to a IRC redirection
	(using a DNS redirection and a "fakeserver"). In phase 3, we use
	the information previously extracted to launch our honeyclient, which
	will capture and monitor the traffic on the C&C channel. Thanks to
	our honeynet, we create a database of the activity of IRC botnets
	(their connection characteristics, commands on the C&C ), and hope
	to learn more about their behavior and the underground market they
	create.},

  year = {2002},
  abstract = {A honeypot is a program, machine, or system put on a network as bait
	for attackers.
	
	The idea is to deceive the attacker by making the honeypot seem like
	a legitimate
	
	system. A honeynet is a network of honeypots set up to imitate a real
	network.
	
	Honeynets can be configured in both production and research environments.
	A
	
	research honeynet studies the tactics and methods of attackers. A
	production honeynet
	
	is set up to mimic the production network of the organization. This
	type of honeynet is
	
	useful to expose the organizations current vulnerabilities. Honeypots
	return highly
	
	valuable data that is much easier to interpret than that of an IDS
	(Intrusion Detection
	
	System). The information gathered from honeypots can be used to better
	prepare
	
	system administrators for attacks.
	
	This paper focuses on the description and analysis of honeypots as
	well as how and
	
	where they are used. I describe the process of setting up and running
	a honeypot.
	
	Commands and associated output is provided to demonstrate how one
	would configure
	
	and install a honeypot. I set up two honeypots in an air-gapped security
	lab to test their
	
	effectiveness. I used the Nmap vulnerability scanner to test each
	of the honeypots in
	
	terms of their ability to emulate various operating systems and services.
	I also describe
	
	any potential problems that I encountered during my testing. This
	paper also takes a
	
	look into the mind of the enemy. Recommendations for honeynets are
	provided.},

  howpublished = {World Wide Web},
  month = {February},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {Honeypots are closely monitored network decoys
	
	serving several purposes: they can distract adversaries
	
	from more valuable machines on a network, they can
	
	provide early warning about new attack and exploitation
	
	trends and they allow in-depth examination of
	
	adversaries during and after exploitation of a honeypot.
	
	Deploying physical honeypots is often time intensive
	
	and expensive as different operating systems require
	
	specialized hardware and every honeypot requires
	
	its own physical system. This paper presents Honeyd, a
	
	framework for virtual honeypots, that simulates virtual
	
	computer systems at the network level. The simulated
	
	computer systems appear to run on unallocated network
	
	addresses. To fool network fingerprinting tools, Honeyd
	
	simulates the networking stack of different operating
	
	systems and can provide arbitrary services for an
	
	arbitrary number of virtual systems. Furthermore, the
	
	system supports virtual routing topologies that allow the
	
	creation of large virtual networks including characteristics
	
	like latency and packet loss. We discuss Honeyd’s
	
	design and implementation.},

	Honeypots

	attacking tools in order to analyze existing and zero-day cyber-attacks.
	As
	
	a number of honeypot architectures and types have been proposed so
	far, an architecture
	
	that will be able to glue various components and mechanisms and provide
	
	a stable infrastructure is needed. NoAH is mainly composed by a core,

	low- and high-interaction honeypots. These honeypots are responsible
	for
	
	interacting with attackers and performing analysis of collected data.
	Apart from
	
	honeypots, NoAH architecture includes several network components,
	such as funneling
	
	and tunneling. These components allow honeypots that are installed
	outside
	
	the NoAH core to collaborate with it and provide an advanced level
